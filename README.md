## About

This repository contains the IoTConnect Arduino SDK and code samples that make use of the SDK.

## Supported Boards

The code has been developed and tested With [SparkFun ESP32 Thing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13907)
and [ESP32-S2-Saola-1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/hw-reference/esp32s2/user-guide-saola-1-v1.2.html)

The SDK depends on the WiFiSecure library and will require a WiFi capable board or a WiFi shield.

The sample provided with the code makes use of the GPIO #2 for LED and #10 for the button example, 
and is based on ESP32 boards.
